Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET using Microsoft Extensions. It showcases the process of adding and configuring services in an IServiceCollection and leveraging the IHost interface to access the IServiceProvider instance. The IServiceProvider serves as the container for all registered services, enabling efficient dependency management and service resolution.
